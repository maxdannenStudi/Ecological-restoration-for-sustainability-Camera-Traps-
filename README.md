# Abiotic-Factors-Mammal-Behaviour
Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between abiotic environmental factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation, wind) and mammalian behavior in an orchard ecosystem near Wendisch Evern, Germany. The study utilizes camera trap observations and weather data to analyze how external conditions influence species activity.

Data Sources

This study integrates two primary data sources:

Wildlife Observation Data

Collected using three camera traps deployed at different locations in the orchard.
Images were processed using Agouti to classify species and extract timestamps.
Deployment IDs and respective cameras:

Camera 1 → 088807f7-414f-4028-a24e-9e5d32c7a413

Camera 2 → aa8b4d44-1da6-4783-820a-25e88db504db

Camera 3 → 70a31176-9505-4a50-9af5-4a7905f4cb60

Weather Data

Sourced from Meteostat, covering 2022, 2023, and 2024.
Key abiotic factors include:
Temperature (°C) – Average, Min, and Max
Precipitation (mm)
